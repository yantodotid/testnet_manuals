# Stake Wars: Episode III. Challenge 008
* Published on: 2022-07-25
* Updated on: 2022-07-25
* Submitted by: Meta Pool
* Rewards: 50 Unlocked NEAR Points (UNP) + 30 Delegated NEAR Points (DNP)

Would you like to contribute to other projects running a validator? Deploy a smart contract on the owner account of a staking pool.

This contract will allow users to split their rewards on multiple accounts.

## Steps

Clone the project found [here](https://github.com/zavodil/near-staking-pool-owner)

```
git clone https://github.com/zavodil/near-staking-pool-owner
```
Compile smart contract

```
cd near-staking-pool-owner/contract
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

Deploy smart contract on your owner account. Adjust the path to .wasm file if required.
```
NEAR_ENV=shardnet near deploy <OWNER_ID>.shardnet.near --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm
```

Initialize the smart contract picking accounts for splitting revenue.
```
CONTRACT_ID=<OWNER_ID>.shardnet.near

# Change numerator and denomitor to adjust the % for split.
near call $CONTRACT_ID new '{"staking_pool_account_id": "<STAKINGPOOL_ID>.factory.shardnet.near", "owner_id":"<OWNER_ID>.shardnet.near", "reward_receivers": [["<SPLITED_ACCOUNT_ID_1>.shardnet.near", {"numerator": 3, "denominator":10}], ["<SPLITED_ACCOUNT_ID_2>.shardnet.near", {"numerator": 70, "denominator":100}]]}' --accountId $CONTRACT_ID
```

Wait until you start receiving rewards on your node staking pool. Do a withdraw of rewards.

```
CONTRACT_ID=<OWNER_ID>.shardnet.near
NEAR_ENV=shardnet near call $CONTRACT_ID withdraw '{}' --accountId $CONTRACT_ID --gas 200000000000000
```

## Acceptance criteria:

* Withdraw is succesfully distributed to 2 accounts.
* In case a bug is found, detailed feedback can alternavely be taken on count.

## Challenge submission

* Challenge URL: The link to the explorer of your *withdraw* transaction.
* Challenge image: Screenshots of tokens distribution transaction.
